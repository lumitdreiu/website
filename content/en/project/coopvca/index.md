title: Handwashing Behavior in Uganda
summary: In cooperation with Viva con Agua, I tried to extend a behavior change tool ([Football 4 Wash](https://vivaconagua.at/uganda/)) with findings from my research. The goal was to promote handwashing behavior among primary school children in Uganda. In the 10 days following the intervention, handwashing behavior increased, especially in critical situations (e.g., before eating).
