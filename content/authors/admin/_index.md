I am a postdoc quantitative researcher at the Social Psychology and Motivation Group at the University of Konstanz. My research interests include decision-making in uncertain contexts, human motivation, and closing the gap between intention and behavior. I manage the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp)-funded project Updating Risk and the [sona subject pool of the University of Konstanz](https://uni-konstanz.sona-systems.com/default.aspx?p_language=EN).

When outside of the office, I like to video games, sports (mainly üèà‚öΩ), and writing extensive about me sections.
